Perfect for both personal use and teams.\n\n## Best for Knowledge Management\n**Obsidian** - Uses local Markdown files with powerful bi-directional linking. Great for building a \"second brain\" and connecting ideas.\n\n## Best for Simplicity\n**Apple Notes** - If you're in the Apple ecosystem, this is surprisingly powerful and syncs seamlessly across devices.\n\n## Best for Collaboration\n**Google Docs** - Not traditionally a note-taking app, but excellent for shared notes and real-time collaboration.\n\n## Best Legacy Option\n**Evernote** - Still a solid choice with powerful search and web clipping, though it's faced competition in recent years.\n\n## Emerging Options\n- **Logseq** - Open-source, outliner-based\n- **Capacities** - Object-based note-taking\n- **Mem** - AI-powered organization\n\nFor most people, I'd recommend starting with Notion or Obsidian depending on whether you prefer cloud-based or local-first."
