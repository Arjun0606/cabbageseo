# AI Visibility Tools Compared: How to Choose the Right One in 2026

A year ago, this category barely existed. Today there are at least half a dozen tools that track whether AI platforms mention your brand when someone asks a relevant question. The reason is straightforward: ChatGPT, Perplexity, and Google AI are answering more questions every month, and the brands they recommend get traffic without ever ranking on a search results page.

If you sell software, run an agency, or manage any business that depends on people finding you online, AI visibility is no longer optional. It is a new channel, and it is growing fast.

The problem is that the category is young enough that no one has written a proper comparison. Most "reviews" are thinly disguised ads. This article is our attempt at an honest breakdown of what exists, what matters, and who each tool is best for. Yes, we make CabbageSEO, so we are biased. We will be upfront about that. But we have also spent enough time in this space to know what the other tools do well.

## Why AI visibility tools exist

Traditional SEO tools track your Google rankings. They tell you where your pages appear in search results for a given keyword. That model does not translate to AI.

When someone asks ChatGPT "what's the best project management tool for remote teams?", the model generates a response based on its training data and any real time retrieval it performs. There is no ranked list of ten blue links. There are three or four brand names in a paragraph. If you are not one of them, you get zero visibility from that query.

AI visibility tools solve this by systematically querying AI platforms with the questions your potential customers are asking, then checking whether your brand shows up in the responses. The better tools go beyond just tracking: they tell you why you are missing, what to fix, and help you build the content needed to get recommended.

## What to look for in an AI visibility tool

Before comparing specific products, it helps to know what features actually matter. Not all tools cover the same ground.

### Multi platform scanning

There are three major AI platforms generating recommendations right now: ChatGPT (OpenAI), Perplexity, and Google AI (Gemini with search grounding). Each uses different models, different retrieval methods, and different training data. A brand can appear in ChatGPT's answers but be completely absent from Perplexity's.

Any tool worth paying for should scan at least two of the three. Ideally all three. Single platform tools give you an incomplete picture.

### Gap detection

Knowing where you are mentioned is useful. Knowing where you are *not* mentioned but should be is far more valuable. The best tools identify queries in your category where competitors appear and you do not. These gaps represent the actual opportunities you need to chase.

### Fix recommendations

Monitoring without guidance is like getting a medical diagnosis with no treatment plan. Look for tools that tell you specifically what to change: which content to create, which third party platforms to get listed on, which pages need structured data improvements, and what trust signals you are missing.

### Content generation

Some tools go a step further and generate the actual fix content for you. This means creating optimized pages, structured FAQ content, or entity definition pages that are designed to help AI platforms better understand and recommend your brand. This saves significant time if you are not running a large content team.

### Trust source tracking

AI platforms rely heavily on third party sources when forming recommendations. If your competitors are listed on G2, Capterra, Product Hunt, and industry directories but you are not, that gap matters. Tools that identify which trust sources you are missing from give you a concrete action list for improving your AI visibility.

### Ongoing monitoring

A one time scan tells you where you stand today. But AI responses change over time as models are updated and retrained. You need ongoing monitoring to track whether your visibility is improving, declining, or being overtaken by a competitor.

## The tools

Here is what is available in 2026 for AI visibility tracking and optimization.

### CabbageSEO

**What it does:** Scans all three major AI platforms (ChatGPT, Perplexity, Google AI) for brand mentions across relevant queries. Identifies gaps where competitors appear and you do not. Generates fix pages and structured content to close those gaps. Provides weekly sprint action plans with prioritized tasks. Tracks trust source coverage and identifies missing third party listings.

**Best for:** SaaS companies and agencies that want scanning and fixing in one tool. If you want to know where you are missing *and* get help fixing it without switching to a separate content tool, this is the value proposition.

**Pricing:** Free initial scan. Paid plans from $49/mo (Scout) to $349/mo (Dominate) depending on number of sites and competitors tracked.

**Strengths:** The scan plus fix combination. Most tools in this space only monitor. CabbageSEO monitors, identifies gaps, and then generates the content and action plans to close those gaps. The sprint system gives you a prioritized weekly workflow instead of a wall of data.

**Limitations:** Newer product, smaller company. The fix page generation is AI powered, which means you should review and edit the output before publishing.

*Full disclosure: this is our product. We have tried to be fair, but take our self assessment with appropriate skepticism.*

### Peekaboo (aipeekaboo.com)

**What it does:** AI visibility tracker covering ChatGPT, Gemini, and Perplexity. Focused primarily on monitoring and tracking brand mentions across AI platforms.

**Best for:** Teams that already have a content workflow and primarily need visibility into where they appear (and do not appear) across AI responses.

**Strengths:** Clean monitoring focused interface. Covers the three major platforms. Good for teams that want awareness data and will handle the optimization work themselves.

**Limitations:** More monitoring focused than action focused. If you need help deciding *what to do* about your visibility gaps, you will need to supplement with other tools or internal expertise.

### Elmo

**What it does:** Focuses on LLMO (Large Language Model Optimization), AEO (Answer Engine Optimization), and GEO optimization. More technical and optimization oriented than pure monitoring tools.

**Best for:** SEO professionals and technical marketers who want deeper control over their optimization strategy and already understand the mechanics of how AI models select brands to recommend.

**Strengths:** Technical depth. If you understand the optimization side and want granular controls, Elmo caters to that audience.

**Limitations:** Steeper learning curve. Less approachable for founders or marketers who want clear next steps without needing to understand the underlying mechanics.

### Promptmonitor

**What it does:** AI visibility tracking with combined web and bot analytics. Tracks how your brand appears in AI generated responses alongside traditional web traffic data.

**Best for:** Teams that want to correlate AI visibility with their existing analytics to understand the full picture of how AI is affecting their traffic.

**Strengths:** The combined analytics angle is useful. Understanding the relationship between AI mentions and actual traffic helps justify investment in GEO optimization.

**Limitations:** The analytics focus means it is stronger on the measurement side than the remediation side.

### Sight AI

**What it does:** AI visibility tracking combined with SEO and GEO optimization features. Aims to bridge traditional SEO workflows with the newer AI visibility category.

**Best for:** Teams transitioning from traditional SEO tools that want AI visibility added to their existing workflow rather than as a completely separate product.

**Strengths:** The bridge between SEO and GEO. If your team is still heavily invested in traditional SEO, a tool that adds AI visibility to that context can reduce friction.

**Limitations:** Bridging two categories means it may not go as deep on the pure AI visibility side as dedicated tools.

### Helm

**What it does:** Platform that automates SEO, GEO, and AI search visibility in a single product. Takes a broader approach by combining traditional search optimization with AI visibility.

**Best for:** Teams looking for an all in one platform that covers both traditional search and AI visibility without running multiple tools.

**Strengths:** Breadth of coverage. If you want one platform for both SEO and GEO, Helm aims to provide that.

**Limitations:** All in one platforms sometimes trade depth for breadth. Evaluate whether the AI visibility features are comprehensive enough for your needs.

### The manual approach

**What it does:** You open ChatGPT, Perplexity, and Google AI yourself and type in queries relevant to your business. You read the responses and note whether your brand is mentioned.

**Best for:** Very early stage companies that want to understand the landscape before committing to a paid tool.

**Strengths:** Free. Gives you a direct, firsthand understanding of how AI platforms talk about your category.

**Limitations:** Does not scale. You can check a handful of queries, but you cannot systematically monitor hundreds of relevant queries across three platforms on an ongoing basis. No historical tracking, no gap analysis, no prioritization. Useful as a starting point, not as a strategy.

## Key differentiators to consider

When evaluating these tools, four factors will narrow your decision quickly.

### Scan only vs scan and fix

This is the biggest dividing line in the category. Most AI visibility tools are built around monitoring: they tell you where you stand. Fewer tools help you actually improve your position. CabbageSEO is the most complete on the scan plus fix side, with generated fix pages and weekly action plans. Elmo offers optimization guidance. The rest lean more toward monitoring.

If you have a content team that can take monitoring data and run with it, a scan only tool may be enough. If you want the tool to tell you exactly what to do and help you do it, look for scan plus fix.

### Number of platforms covered

Three is the minimum that matters right now: ChatGPT, Perplexity, and Google AI (Gemini). Each platform has different behavior and different source preferences. A tool that only scans one platform is giving you a third of the picture.

### Price

Pricing in this category ranges from free manual checking to several hundred dollars per month. The question is not "what is cheapest" but "what saves the most time relative to its cost." A $49/month tool that saves your team five hours a week of manual checking and content planning pays for itself immediately.

### Agency support

If you manage multiple client sites, you need a tool that handles multiple domains without requiring separate accounts. Check whether multi site support is included in the plan or requires enterprise pricing.

## Who should use what

Here is a simplified decision framework based on team size and needs.

**Solo SaaS founder with one product:** Start with CabbageSEO's free scan to see where you stand. If the gaps are significant, the Scout plan ($49/mo) gives you scanning across all three platforms plus fix pages and action plans for a single site. This is the most cost effective way to go from "I have no idea if AI recommends me" to "I have a weekly plan to fix that."

**Growing company with a small marketing team:** CabbageSEO's Command plan ($149/mo) covers up to 5 sites with 10 competitors tracked. If you have multiple products or domains, this is the tier where you get full coverage. Alternatively, if your team is technically strong and prefers to build their own optimization workflow, Elmo's technical depth could be a better fit paired with a monitoring tool.

**Agency managing client sites:** CabbageSEO's Dominate plan ($349/mo) supports up to 25 sites, which covers most agency portfolios. Helm's all in one approach could also work if you want traditional SEO and AI visibility combined. Evaluate both based on your existing toolstack.

**Enterprise with existing SEO infrastructure:** Look at Sight AI or Helm for bridging your current SEO tools with AI visibility. Or use CabbageSEO alongside your existing SEO suite, treating AI visibility as a distinct channel with its own dedicated tool.

**Just getting started and not ready to pay:** Use the manual approach for two weeks. Pick 20 to 30 queries your customers might ask AI platforms and check them yourself across ChatGPT, Perplexity, and Google AI. This will teach you more about AI visibility than any article can. When you are ready to systematize, pick a paid tool.

## The bottom line

AI visibility is a new category, and the tools are evolving fast. Six months from now, this comparison will probably need updating. What will not change is the underlying dynamic: AI platforms are answering more questions, recommending specific brands in those answers, and the brands they recommend are capturing attention that used to flow through search results.

The tool you choose matters less than the decision to start tracking and optimizing for AI visibility at all. Any of the tools above is better than ignoring the channel entirely.

That said, if you want our honest recommendation: start with a free scan, see where you stand, and then decide whether you need monitoring only or monitoring plus fixes. Your answer to that question will narrow the field quickly.
