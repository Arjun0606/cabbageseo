# How to Get Recommended by ChatGPT: The Complete GEO Guide

Right now, someone is asking ChatGPT "what's the best [your category] tool?" and getting an answer. Your brand is either in that answer, or it isn't. There's no page two. There's no "close to ranking." You're recommended, or you're invisible.

This guide covers exactly how to change that.

## What is GEO and why does it matter right now?

Generative Engine Optimization (GEO) is the practice of making your brand, product, or service show up when AI platforms generate recommendations. It's the equivalent of SEO, but for a fundamentally different system.

Traditional search shows ten links. The user clicks around, compares, decides. AI search gives a direct answer: "Here are the best project management tools: Notion, Linear, Asana..." If you're not named, the buyer never even knows you exist.

This isn't a future problem. It's happening now:

- ChatGPT has hundreds of millions of active users. A significant chunk of them ask product and service questions daily.
- Perplexity is growing fast as a research-first AI search engine that cites its sources.
- Google AI Overviews now appear on the majority of commercial search queries, pushing organic results below the fold.

The shift is structural. Buyers are moving from "search and browse" to "ask and act." If your growth strategy is built entirely on Google rankings, you have a gap that's widening every month.

## How ChatGPT decides who to recommend

Before diving into tactics, it helps to understand what's actually happening when ChatGPT generates a recommendation. It's not magic, and it's not random. There's a logic to it, even if it's different from Google's algorithm.

### Training data and knowledge cutoff

ChatGPT's base knowledge comes from its training data — a massive corpus of web pages, books, articles, and code scraped before its knowledge cutoff date. If your brand appeared frequently and positively across authoritative sources in that training data, the model "knows" about you.

But this isn't static. ChatGPT now has web browsing capabilities, and models are updated regularly. Fresh content matters.

### Entity recognition

The model identifies brands as entities — distinct things with properties, categories, and relationships. When ChatGPT says "Linear is a project management tool built for engineering teams," it's drawing on entity knowledge: what Linear is, what category it belongs to, who it's for.

The stronger and more consistent your entity signal across the web, the more confidently AI can place you in the right context. If your brand appears in scattered, inconsistent ways — sometimes described as a CRM, sometimes as a marketing tool, sometimes with no clear description at all — the model has weak entity knowledge about you.

### Citations and source authority

When ChatGPT browses the web to answer a question, it looks for authoritative sources. G2 reviews, Capterra listings, industry publications, comparison articles, and well-structured product pages all serve as citation-worthy sources.

If your brand appears on zero third-party sources, there's nothing for the model to cite. If you're reviewed on G2, mentioned in a TechCrunch roundup, and have comparison pages that rank well — those become ammunition for AI to reference when recommending you.

### Freshness signals

AI platforms increasingly weigh recency. A product with reviews from 2024 and no recent activity looks abandoned. A product with recent reviews, fresh blog content, and up-to-date comparison pages looks active and trustworthy.

## The action plan: 8 steps to get recommended

### 1. Nail your entity clarity

AI needs to understand what you are in one sentence. This sounds simple, but most companies fail at it.

Go to your homepage. Can a machine read it and immediately understand:
- What category you're in?
- What problem you solve?
- Who your target customer is?

If your homepage is a wall of vague marketing copy ("Transform your workflow with next-gen solutions"), AI can't parse that into a useful entity. Instead, be explicit: "Acme is a proposal automation tool for freelance designers."

**What to do:**
- Write a clear, factual one-sentence description of your product on your homepage, about page, and every landing page.
- Use schema.org structured data (Organization, Product, SoftwareApplication) to declare your entity properties in machine-readable format.
- Make sure your brand name, category, and description are consistent across every page on your site and every third-party listing.

### 2. Create comparison and "vs" pages

This is the single highest-leverage GEO tactic. When someone asks ChatGPT "what's the difference between X and Y?", the model needs source material to draw from. Comparison pages are that source material.

Create pages like:
- "[Your Brand] vs [Competitor]" for your top 3-5 competitors
- "Best [category] tools in 2026" — yes, you can publish this yourself if it's genuinely useful and fair
- "[Your Brand] alternatives" — counterintuitive, but this captures the query and lets you control the narrative

**What to do:**
- Build comparison pages that are genuinely informative. Include feature tables, pricing comparisons, and honest pros/cons. AI can detect (and ignores) pages that are just thinly-veiled sales pitches.
- Structure these with clear headings, bullet points, and tables. AI parses structured content far more effectively than prose paragraphs.

### 3. Get listed on trust sources

Third-party mentions are one of the strongest GEO signals. AI platforms trust information that comes from independent sources, not just your own website.

The key platforms to target:

- **G2** — the dominant B2B software review site. A G2 profile with real reviews is table stakes.
- **Capterra / GetApp / Software Advice** (all Gartner) — broad reach, good for discovery.
- **Product Hunt** — especially for launches and initial visibility.
- **Industry-specific directories** — every niche has them. Find yours and get listed.
- **Wikipedia** (if notable enough) — the ultimate entity signal, but strict notability requirements.

**What to do:**
- Create profiles on G2 and Capterra this week. Ask 5-10 real customers to leave reviews.
- Submit to Product Hunt if you haven't already.
- Find 3-5 industry directories relevant to your category and get listed.

### 4. Build citation-worthy content

AI cites content that answers questions directly and authoritatively. The content on your site needs to be the kind of thing a journalist or researcher would reference.

This means:
- **Original data or benchmarks.** If you can publish stats from your own product ("We analyzed 10,000 proposals and found the average close rate is 23%"), that's citation gold.
- **Definitive guides.** Comprehensive, well-structured resources that cover a topic thoroughly.
- **Expert perspectives.** Named author, clear credentials, specific opinions backed by evidence.

What AI ignores: generic blog posts that restate obvious information, thin content that exists only for keyword targeting, and pages with no clear author or authority signal.

**What to do:**
- Audit your top 10 blog posts. Are any of them genuinely useful enough that someone would cite them? If not, rewrite or consolidate.
- Publish one piece of original research or data per quarter. It doesn't need to be a massive report — even a single interesting stat with methodology is valuable.

### 5. Implement structured data (schema markup)

Structured data is how you speak to machines in their native language. It's JSON-LD markup that tells search engines and AI platforms exactly what your page is about, in a format they can parse without ambiguity.

**Key schema types for GEO:**
- `Organization` — your company details, logo, founding date, description
- `Product` or `SoftwareApplication` — what you sell, pricing, features
- `FAQPage` — question-and-answer pairs that AI can directly extract
- `Review` and `AggregateRating` — social proof in machine-readable format
- `HowTo` — step-by-step instructions
- `Article` — authorship, publication date, topic

**What to do:**
- Add Organization schema to your homepage.
- Add FAQPage schema to any page that has Q&A content. This is high-leverage because AI platforms directly consume FAQ schema.
- Add Product/SoftwareApplication schema to your pricing and product pages.
- Validate with Google's Rich Results Test.

### 6. Build authority backlinks (yes, they still matter)

Backlinks from authoritative domains serve double duty. They help your SEO, and they create the web of third-party mentions that AI uses to establish trust.

But the type of backlink matters more for GEO than for SEO. A link from a niche blog with 50 readers but genuine authority in your space is more valuable to AI than a link from a generic high-DA site that has no relevance to your category.

**What to do:**
- Guest post on industry publications where your target buyers actually read. Focus on 2-3 pieces of genuinely useful content, not a spray of low-quality posts.
- Get quoted as an expert in roundup articles ("10 experts share their predictions for...").
- Build integrations with complementary tools and get listed on their integrations/partners page.

### 7. Publish FAQ content that AI can extract

FAQ pages are disproportionately valuable for GEO. When someone asks ChatGPT a specific question about your category, the model often pulls from FAQ-style content because it's already in question-answer format.

**What to do:**
- Create a comprehensive FAQ page on your site with 15-20 real questions your customers ask. Not marketing fluff — actual questions from support tickets, sales calls, and onboarding.
- Use FAQPage schema markup so AI can parse it cleanly.
- Include questions like "What is [your product]?", "How does [your product] compare to [competitor]?", "What does [your product] cost?", and "Who is [your product] best for?"

### 8. Keep it fresh

AI models are updated regularly, and platforms like Perplexity and ChatGPT with browsing check for recency. A product that hasn't been mentioned anywhere in 6 months looks stale.

**What to do:**
- Update your comparison pages quarterly with current pricing and features.
- Ask for new customer reviews on G2 and Capterra every month.
- Publish at least 1-2 pieces of fresh content per month — blog posts, case studies, or updated guides.
- Update the "last updated" date on your key pages when you make changes (and use schema markup to declare it).

## Common mistakes that keep you invisible

**Thin landing pages.** A page with 200 words and three bullet points gives AI nothing to work with. AI needs substantive content to understand what you do and why it should recommend you.

**No structured data.** If you have zero schema markup, you're making AI guess what your pages are about. Don't make it guess.

**Ignoring third-party sources.** You can optimize your own site perfectly and still be invisible to AI if no one else on the internet mentions you. Third-party validation is non-negotiable.

**Inconsistent entity signals.** If your homepage says you're a "marketing automation platform," your G2 listing says "email marketing tool," and your LinkedIn says "growth platform," AI has conflicting entity data. Pick a description and use it everywhere.

**Keyword stuffing instead of structuring.** SEO habits die hard. Repeating your target keyword 47 times on a page does nothing for AI. Clear structure, honest descriptions, and substantive content are what matter.

**Never checking what AI actually says.** Many companies have never once asked ChatGPT or Perplexity about their own category. This is the equivalent of never checking your Google rankings. You can't fix what you don't measure.

## How to measure your GEO progress

You can't improve what you can't measure, and GEO measurement is different from SEO measurement. There are no "keyword rankings" in the traditional sense. Instead, you're tracking whether AI platforms recommend you, how often, and in what context.

**Manual approach (free but slow):**
Ask ChatGPT, Perplexity, and Google AI 10-15 buyer questions relevant to your category. Record whether you're mentioned, what position you appear in, and what the AI says about you. Repeat monthly.

**Automated approach (what CabbageSEO does):**
CabbageSEO scans all three major AI platforms with real buyer queries and produces a 6-factor visibility score that tracks:

- Whether you're mentioned at all (citation presence)
- How prominently you're mentioned (recommendation strength)
- What the AI says about you (sentiment and accuracy)
- How you compare to competitors (competitive position)
- Which platforms mention you (platform coverage)
- How your visibility changes over time (momentum)

This gives you a single score to track over time, plus specific, prioritized actions to improve it.

## Start now, not later

GEO is a compounding game. The brands that build strong entity signals, third-party presence, and structured content now will be increasingly hard to displace as AI search grows. Every month you wait is a month your competitors are building their AI presence without you.

The good news: unlike SEO, which can take 6-12 months to show results, GEO improvements can show up in AI recommendations within 2-4 weeks as models update their knowledge.
