## 🎯 Key Principles Applied

1. **Remove enterprise language:**
   - ❌ "Market Share" → ✅ "AI Visibility"
   - ❌ "Revenue Loss" → ✅ "Queries where you're invisible"
   - ❌ "Intelligence" → ✅ Removed
   - ❌ "Analytics" → ✅ Removed

2. **Focus on invisibility, not loss:**
   - ❌ "You're losing $X/month" → ✅ "AI recommended X competitors instead of you"
   - ❌ "Revenue intelligence" → ✅ "AI Visibility Status"

3. **Make it personal:**
   - ❌ "Competitive Analysis" → ✅ "Who AI trusts instead"
   - ❌ "Source Attribution" → ✅ "Where AI learned about them"

4. **Target solo founders:**
   - Added "Works best for SaaS, micro-SaaS, and online tools"
   - Changed "For solo founders" in pricing
   - Removed enterprise-feeling language
