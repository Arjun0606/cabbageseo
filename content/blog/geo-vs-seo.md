# GEO vs SEO: What's Different in 2026

SEO is about getting Google to rank your page. GEO is about getting AI to recommend your brand. Both matter. But they work differently, reward different things, and require different tactics.

If your entire growth strategy is built on SEO, you're optimizing for a system that's rapidly sharing its audience with AI. This article breaks down exactly what's different and what you need to do about it.

## The core difference

**SEO** optimizes for a crawl-and-rank algorithm. Googlebot crawls your page, indexes it, evaluates it against hundreds of ranking signals (backlinks, page speed, keyword relevance, domain authority), and places it in a ranked list. Users see that list and click.

**GEO** optimizes for an understand-and-recommend system. AI models read vast amounts of web content, build an internal understanding of brands, categories, and relationships, then generate a direct answer when someone asks a question. There's no list to rank on. Either you're in the answer, or you're not.

This is a fundamental shift. In SEO, ranking #4 still gets you traffic. In GEO, if the AI names three tools and you're not one of them, you get nothing.

## What each system rewards

### Keywords vs entities

SEO rewards keyword optimization. If someone searches "best email marketing software," Google looks for pages that contain and are relevant to that phrase. Keyword research, placement, and density still drive a lot of SEO outcomes.

GEO rewards entity clarity. When someone asks ChatGPT "what's the best email marketing software?", the model doesn't match keywords — it draws on its understanding of which brands exist in the email marketing category, what their reputations are, and which ones it can confidently recommend.

**Practical difference:** For SEO, you optimize a page around a keyword cluster. For GEO, you make sure AI platforms clearly understand what your brand is, what category it belongs to, and why it's credible in that category. This means consistent descriptions across your site, structured data markup, and presence on third-party sources that reinforce your entity.

### Backlinks vs citations

In SEO, backlinks are the currency. A link from a high-authority domain passes "link juice" to your page, improving its ranking potential. The quantity and quality of your backlink profile is one of the most important ranking factors.

In GEO, what matters is being mentioned — cited — across sources that AI considers trustworthy. A G2 review, a mention in a Capterra roundup, a comparison on an industry blog, an entry in a relevant directory — these are the "citations" that GEO cares about. The link itself matters less than the mention.

**Practical difference:** For SEO, you'd pursue a guest post to get a dofollow backlink. For GEO, you'd pursue a guest post because it creates a third-party mention of your brand in a relevant context — and the AI will encounter that mention whether or not there's a hyperlink.

### Page rank vs trust signals

Google assigns every page a quality score based on signals like domain authority, page authority, content quality, and user engagement. You can track your ranking position for specific keywords and work to improve it.

AI platforms don't have an equivalent ranking. Instead, they evaluate trust signals: How many independent sources mention this brand? Are those sources authoritative? Is the information consistent? Is it recent? AI forms a holistic "impression" of your brand rather than assigning a position.

**Practical difference:** In SEO, you can rank #1 for a keyword with a single well-optimized page. In GEO, a single page doesn't move the needle much — what matters is the breadth and consistency of your presence across the web.

### SERP position vs recommendation inclusion

SEO has a clear metric: your position in search results. Position 1-3 gets most of the clicks. Position 11+ (page two) gets almost nothing.

GEO has a binary metric at its core: are you in the AI's answer, or not? There are nuances — being the first brand mentioned is better than being the fourth, and being described positively is better than being mentioned with caveats — but the primary question is inclusion.

**Practical difference:** SEO improvements are incremental. Moving from position 8 to position 5 gets you more traffic. GEO improvements are more binary. You're either in the recommendation or you're not, and the work is about crossing that threshold.

## Where SEO and GEO overlap

This isn't all-or-nothing. Several tactics serve both systems:

- **High-quality content** that thoroughly covers a topic helps you rank in Google and gives AI substantive material to draw from.
- **Structured data (schema markup)** helps Google understand your pages for rich snippets, and helps AI parse your content for recommendations.
- **Authority backlinks** improve your domain authority for SEO and create the third-party mentions that GEO relies on.
- **Fresh content** signals to Google that your site is active, and signals to AI that your brand is current and relevant.

The overlap is real. Good content marketing helps both. But the priorities shift depending on which system you're optimizing for.

## Where they diverge: practical examples

### Example 1: Landing page optimization

**SEO approach:** Research target keywords, optimize title tag, write keyword-rich H1 and body copy, build internal links, optimize page speed and Core Web Vitals.

**GEO approach:** Write a clear one-sentence description of your product that a machine can parse. Add Organization and Product schema. Include a FAQ section with real questions and direct answers. Make sure the page clearly states your category, target customer, and key differentiators — not in marketing language, but in plain, factual terms.

### Example 2: Competitor strategy

**SEO approach:** Analyze competitor backlink profiles, find keyword gaps, create content targeting keywords they rank for but you don't.

**GEO approach:** Ask ChatGPT and Perplexity about your category. See who gets recommended and who doesn't. Create comparison pages ("Your Brand vs Competitor") with honest, structured feature comparisons. Get listed on the same review platforms where competitors have profiles.

### Example 3: Content strategy

**SEO approach:** Build a content calendar around keyword research. Target high-volume, low-competition keywords. Create blog posts optimized for each cluster.

**GEO approach:** Build content that AI would cite as authoritative. Publish original data, comprehensive guides, and FAQ content structured with clear headings and schema markup. Create "best [category] tools" pages that are genuinely useful. Focus on being citation-worthy, not keyword-optimized.

## Why you need both

SEO isn't dead. Google still processes billions of searches daily. Organic traffic from traditional search is still valuable and isn't disappearing overnight.

But the trajectory is clear. AI-powered search is growing fast. Google itself is pushing AI Overviews above organic results. Perplexity is gaining market share. ChatGPT handles product research questions that would have gone to Google two years ago.

If you only do SEO, you're optimizing for a shrinking share of how people find products. If you only do GEO, you're ignoring a massive traffic source that still works.

The smart play is both. And the good news is that many GEO tactics — structured data, authoritative content, third-party presence — also help your SEO.

The difference is in emphasis. SEO teams that never check what AI says about their brand are leaving an increasingly large gap in their strategy. And that gap gets bigger every quarter.

## How to start

If you've been doing SEO and want to add GEO to your strategy, start with three things:

1. **Check your AI visibility.** Ask ChatGPT and Perplexity about your category. Are you mentioned? What does the AI say about you? How do competitors compare? This baseline tells you where you stand.

2. **Add structured data.** If you have zero schema markup, adding Organization, Product, and FAQPage schema is the highest-leverage first step.

3. **Build third-party presence.** Get listed on G2, Capterra, and relevant industry directories. Ask customers for reviews. These third-party mentions are the citations AI relies on.
