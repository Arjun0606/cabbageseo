# 🚀 Product Hunt Launch Checklist

**CRITICAL:** This is what actually moves revenue. No fluff.

---

## ✅ Must Be True (Blocking)

### Free User Experience
- [ ] Free user sees results in <60 seconds
- [ ] One action is obvious without scrolling
- [ ] Upgrade CTA says what they get, not the plan name
  - ✅ "Show me the full checklist"
  - ❌ "Upgrade to Starter"

### Starter User Experience
- [ ] Starter user can check off at least one step
- [ ] Progress summary visible at top of dashboard
- [ ] "Expected Outcome" shown for each step
- [ ] Clear "next best action" displayed

### Pro User Experience
- [ ] "AI Visibility Mode: Active" shown at top
- [ ] "This Week's AI Visibility Moves" (not "Weekly Playbook")
- [ ] Limited to 3 actions max (scarcity > abundance)

### General
- [ ] No empty states, ever
- [ ] No enterprise language anywhere
- [ ] All copy targets solo founders, not "businesses"

---

## ✅ Homepage Polish

### Hero Section
- [x] Headline: "AI is choosing your competitors."
- [x] Subheadline: Shows what CabbageSEO does (who, where, what to fix)
- [x] CTA: "See who AI recommends →"
- [x] Subtext: "Takes ~10 seconds. No signup required."

### Product Hunt Tagline Options

**Best:**
"See who ChatGPT recommends instead of you — and how to fix it."

**Other good options:**
- "AI decides who gets customers. See if you're invisible."
- "The first analytics tool for AI recommendations."

**Avoid:**
- "SEO" (too generic)
- "Enterprise" (wrong audience)
- "Revenue intelligence" (too buzzwordy)

---

## ✅ Niche Focus

**Primary:** Solo SaaS & micro-SaaS founders

**Why:**
- They search their own product in ChatGPT
- They feel distribution pain acutely
- They pay $29–$79 without procurement
- They share on Twitter / Indie Hackers

**Secondary:** Shopify (later, not first)

**Copy should scream:**
- "Built for solo founders"
- NOT "businesses"

---

## ✅ Nice to Have (Not Blocking)

### Pre-Launch
- [ ] Tweet thread ready
- [ ] Founder comment ready (explaining why you built this)
- [ ] Screenshot showing competitors beating you
- [ ] Demo video (optional but helpful)

### Launch Day
- [ ] Post at 12:01 AM PST (Tuesday, Wednesday, or Thursday)
- [ ] Share in Indie Hackers
- [ ] Share on Twitter/X
- [ ] DM 10-20 solo founders directly
- [ ] Respond to every comment within 1 hour

---

## ✅ What's Already Strong (Don't Touch)

- ✅ Immediate auto-scan (non-negotiable)
- ✅ Losses-first framing ("AI recommends competitors")
- ✅ Named competitors (huge psychologically)
- ✅ At least one actionable step per tier
- ✅ Honest data (no fake money numbers) → trust
- ✅ Clear ladder: Free → Starter → Pro

---

## ✅ Conversion Leaks Fixed

### Leak #1: Free tier feels like homework
- ✅ Added micro-win indicator
- ✅ Changed CTA to "Show me the full checklist"
- ✅ Made task feel finite ("You can finish Step 1 today")

### Leak #2: Starter doesn't create win moment fast enough
- ✅ Added progress summary card
- ✅ Added "Expected Outcome" to each step
- ✅ Shows "next best action" clearly

### Leak #3: Pro needs stronger identity
- ✅ Added "AI Visibility Mode: Active"
- ✅ Changed "Weekly Playbook" to "This Week's AI Visibility Moves"
- ✅ Limited to 3 actions (scarcity)

## 🎯 Final Reassurance

**You're scared because:**

**But here's the truth:**

- It delivers value immediately
- It tells the truth
