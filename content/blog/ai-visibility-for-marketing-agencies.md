# AI Visibility for Marketing Agencies: A New Service Your Clients Will Pay For

Here's the pitch you're about to start hearing from every client in your portfolio: "We need to show up when people ask ChatGPT about us."

They're right. And if you're not already offering AI visibility as a service, you're leaving serious money on the table. Not eventually. Right now.

This article is for agency owners and strategists who want to understand the shift, figure out how to package it, and start selling it. No theory. Just the mechanics of a new service line that your clients actually need and will pay real money for.

## The shift is already here

Two years ago, nearly every product research journey started with a Google search. "Best CRM for small businesses." "Top project management tools for agencies." "Email marketing platform with good automation."

That behavior is fragmenting fast. A growing share of those queries now goes to ChatGPT, Perplexity, or gets answered by Google's own AI Overviews before the user ever sees an organic result.

The difference is structural. Google shows ten links and lets the user decide. AI gives a direct answer: "Here are the best CRMs for small businesses: HubSpot, Pipedrive, Close..." If your client isn't named in that answer, the buyer never knows they exist. There is no page two. There is no "we almost ranked." They're either recommended or invisible.

ChatGPT has hundreds of millions of active users. Perplexity is growing double digits month over month. Google AI Overviews now appear on the majority of commercial searches, pushing organic results below the fold. Every quarter, more buyer decisions are influenced by AI before anyone clicks a link.

Your clients are going to feel this. Some already are.

## Why this matters specifically for agencies

If you run an agency, this isn't just an interesting trend to watch. It's a revenue opportunity.

Think about how SEO became an agency service. For a while, only a handful of companies offered it. Then every agency added it because clients started asking. The agencies that moved early built the biggest practices.

AI visibility is at that early stage right now. Most agencies aren't offering it. Most clients don't even know they should be asking for it. That's the window.

Here's what makes it attractive as a service line:

**It's additive, not cannibalistic.** AI visibility doesn't replace SEO, PPC, content marketing, or any other service you currently sell. It's a new layer. Your SEO team keeps doing SEO. Your content team keeps producing content. AI visibility management is a distinct offering with its own deliverables and its own line item on the invoice.

**Clients need it explained to them.** Most businesses have never once asked ChatGPT about their own category. They have no idea what AI says about them, whether they're recommended, or what their competitors' AI presence looks like. When you show them the gap, the conversation sells itself.

**It's recurring revenue.** AI visibility isn't a one time fix. AI models update constantly. Competitors move. New queries emerge. This is a monitoring and optimization service that runs month after month, just like SEO retainers.

**The margin is excellent.** More on this below, but the short version is: your tooling cost is fixed and low, and the value you deliver is high and ongoing.

## What AI visibility actually means

Before you can sell this, you need to be able to explain it in plain English. Here's the framework.

AI visibility is whether your client's brand shows up when someone asks an AI platform a buying question related to their category. That's it. It's the AI equivalent of "do you rank on Google for your target keywords?"

But instead of keywords and rankings, you're tracking:

**Citation presence.** Does the AI actually link to your client's website as a source? This is the strongest signal. It means AI trusts the site enough to point users directly to it.

**Brand mentions.** Does the AI name the brand in its response? Being mentioned by name in a recommendation like "Consider [Brand] for its automation features" is valuable even without a direct link.

**Platform coverage.** Does the client show up on ChatGPT, Perplexity, and Google AI, or just one? Coverage across all three matters because buyers use different platforms.

**Competitive position.** When AI lists several options, where does the client appear? First or fifth? And who else is being recommended alongside them?

**Sentiment.** What does the AI actually say about the brand? "It's a solid option for small teams" is very different from "it has limited features compared to alternatives."

When you scan a client's AI visibility for the first time, you'll almost always find gaps. Most businesses are partially visible at best, completely invisible at worst. Those gaps are your pitch.

## The discovery call that sells itself

Here's a process that works. It takes about 15 minutes of prep per client.

**Step 1: Run a scan.** Before the call, run the client's domain through an AI visibility scanner. You want to see their score across ChatGPT, Perplexity, and Google AI, plus the specific queries where they do and don't appear.

**Step 2: Find the money query.** Every business has one. It's the query their ideal buyer would type into ChatGPT. For a CRM company, it's "best CRM for small businesses." For a law firm, it's "best divorce lawyer in [city]." For a SaaS tool, it's "best [category] tool for [their target customer]."

**Step 3: Show them the gap.** On the call, share your screen. Type the money query into ChatGPT. Read the answer together. Either the client is in the answer or they're not. If they're not, you've just demonstrated the problem in 30 seconds. If they are, check Perplexity and Google AI. Very few brands are visible across all three.

**Step 4: Show a competitor who IS visible.** This is the part that lights the fire. Find one of their direct competitors who does show up in AI recommendations. Show the client: "When someone asks ChatGPT for the best [category], [Competitor] gets recommended and you don't. Every day, buyers are being told to consider your competitor and never hearing about you."

That's the discovery call. You're not selling. You're showing.

## How to package and price the service

Here's where the agency economics get interesting.

**What you deliver monthly:**

- AI visibility audit across ChatGPT, Perplexity, and Google AI (automated scans, not manual)
- Monthly report showing visibility score, changes, and competitive positioning
- Prioritized action plan: which pages to create, which structured data to add, which third party profiles to claim or improve
- Content recommendations specifically designed to improve AI citations
- Fix pages: comparison content, FAQ content, schema markup, and other assets that directly improve how AI understands and recommends the client

**What you charge:** $500 to $2,000 per month per client, depending on scope and size. Enterprise clients with multiple product lines can go higher. The justification is straightforward: if AI is sending their competitors buyers and not them, every month of inaction has a cost.

**What you pay for tooling:** A single CabbageSEO Dominate subscription at $349/mo covers up to 25 sites. That means you can manage up to 25 clients on one account. If you're charging an average of $1,000/mo per client and managing 10 clients, your revenue is $10,000/mo against $349 in tooling cost.

That's the math that makes this service line compelling. The tooling is a fixed, low cost. Everything above it is margin.

## Real world example: the CRM query

Let's make this concrete. Say you have a client that sells CRM software for small businesses. Decent product, solid customer base, ranks reasonably well on Google for a few keywords.

Open ChatGPT. Type: "What's the best CRM for small businesses?"

ChatGPT lists HubSpot, Pipedrive, Zoho, maybe Freshsales. If your client isn't on that list, the buyer never visits their website, never sees their ad, never enters their funnel. They clicked through to a named tool and signed up.

Now ask Perplexity the same question. Different sources, potentially different answers. Check Google AI Overviews too. Three platforms, three chances to be visible or invisible.

Your client is probably invisible on at least one of them. Maybe all three. That's the service you're selling: we'll get you recommended by the AI tools your buyers are actually using.

And here's the thing — this isn't like SEO where you're fighting for incremental position improvements from spot 8 to spot 5. In AI recommendations, you're either in the answer or you're not. Going from invisible to mentioned is a step change in visibility, not an incremental gain. That makes it easier to demonstrate value.

## What the work actually looks like

Once a client signs up for AI visibility management, here's what you're doing each month.

**Week 1: Scan and diagnose.** Run the AI visibility scan. Review the score breakdown. Identify which platforms the client is missing from and which queries they should be appearing for but aren't.

**Week 2: Fix the foundations.** Add structured data (schema markup) to key pages if it's missing. Create or update the client's G2, Capterra, and relevant directory profiles. Make sure the homepage clearly states what the business is, what category it's in, and who it's for — in plain language a machine can parse, not marketing jargon.

**Week 3: Create citation content.** Build comparison pages ("[Client] vs [Competitor]"), FAQ pages with real buyer questions and direct answers, and category pages ("Best [X] tools for [Y]") that AI platforms can cite. This is the highest leverage work. One well structured comparison page can shift AI recommendations within weeks.

**Week 4: Report and plan.** Generate the monthly visibility report. Show the client their score changes, new citations gained, and competitive movements. Present next month's action plan.

Repeat. Every month, the client's AI visibility improves. Every month, you have a report that shows progress. Every month, they have a reason to keep paying.

## Getting started without overbuilding

You don't need to hire a team or build custom tools to start offering this. Here's a minimal viable approach.

**Start with 3 to 5 existing clients.** Pick clients you already manage SEO or content for. Run their AI visibility scans. Show them the results. Pitch the service as an add-on.

**Use existing infrastructure.** The content creation work (comparison pages, FAQ pages, schema markup) is similar to what your content and SEO teams already produce. The strategic layer is new, but the execution uses existing skills.

**Start at a price point you're comfortable with.** If $1,500/mo feels too aggressive for your client base, start at $500/mo and increase as you build case studies. The margin still works because your tooling cost doesn't change.

**Build your case study fast.** Your first 2 to 3 clients are your proof. Track their visibility scores before and after. Document the improvement. Use those numbers to sell to the next 10 clients.

Within three months, you can have a running AI visibility practice with recurring revenue, strong margins, and a clear differentiation from every other agency in your market that's still only talking about SEO.

## The window is open

AI visibility management is where SEO was in 2010. Everyone knows it matters. Very few agencies are actually offering it. The ones that move now will own the category in their market.

Your clients are already being affected by AI recommendations whether they know it or not. The question is whether you're the agency that shows them the problem and fixes it, or whether someone else does.
