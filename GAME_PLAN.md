## 🏆 Competitive Positioning

### SEObot ($100K MRR) - What They Do Right
1. **Dead simple**: "Enter URL, press go"
2. **Fully autonomous**: No learning curve
3. **Clear value**: "200k articles, 1.2B impressions"
4. **One price**: $49/mo (upsells later)
5. **Founder story**: Authentic, relatable

### CabbageSEO - Our Unfair Advantage
1. **AIO Score**: No one else measures AI visibility
2. **Platform-specific optimization**: Google AI, ChatGPT, Perplexity
3. **Export for Cursor**: Unique to vibe coders
4. **Lower price**: $29/mo vs $49/mo
5. **AIO-first content**: Articles optimized for AI citation

## 🎯 The Niche to Own

### Market Reality
- SEO tools: Saturated ($100B+ market, giants dominate)
- AIO tools: **WIDE OPEN** (No dominant player)

### Our Position
> "The only tool that optimizes your content to be cited by AI"

| Competitor | Focus | AIO? |
|------------|-------|------|
| SEObot | Google SEO | ❌ |
| ChatSEO | GSC analysis | ❌ |
| Surfer | Content optimization | ❌ |
| Ahrefs/Semrush | Enterprise SEO | ❌ |
| **CabbageSEO** | **AI Visibility** | ✅ **ONLY ONE** |

---

## 📍 Simplified Messaging

### Before (Too Complex)
> "The SEO tool for SaaS, startups, and indie makers. Generate AI-optimized content that ranks in Google AND gets cited by ChatGPT."

### After (AIO-First)
> "Is AI citing your content? CabbageSEO helps you get featured in ChatGPT, Perplexity, and Google AI Overviews."

### One-liner
> "Get cited by AI. Not just ranked on Google."

---

## 🔄 Simplified User Flow

### Current Flow (Too Many Choices)
```
Dashboard → 5 nav items → Multiple features → Confusion
```

### Ideal Flow (SEObot-style)
```
1. Enter URL
2. See AIO Score (the hook)
3. Get specific fixes
4. Generate AIO-optimized content
5. Publish
```

---

## 📊 Feature Priorities

### KEEP & PROMOTE (Core AIO)
1. **AIO Score** - Your unique metric
2. **Platform Breakdown** - Google AI, ChatGPT, Perplexity  
3. **AIO Recommendations** - Actionable fixes
4. **Export for Cursor** - Unique value for devs
5. **Content Generation** - But AIO-optimized

### KEEP BUT DE-EMPHASIZE (Supporting)
- SEO Audit (it's useful, but not the differentiator)
- Keywords (helpful, but SEMrush does this better)

### CUT (Not Core)
- Analytics integration (complex, not your value)
- GSC connection (same)
- Internal linking (nice to have, not core)
