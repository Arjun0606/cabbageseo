# Does ChatGPT Recommend Your Business? Here's How to Check (and What to Do If It Doesn't)

Stop reading this for 30 seconds. Open ChatGPT. Type "what's the best [your category] tool?" and hit enter.

Did your business show up?

If it didn't, you just watched a potential customer get sent somewhere else. And that's not a one-time event. That question is being asked hundreds of thousands of times a day, across ChatGPT, Perplexity, and Google AI. Every single time, the answer is a short list of 3 to 5 names. No pagination, no "next page," no scrolling through ten blue links. Either you're on the list, or you don't exist to that buyer.

This is the new reality of search. And most businesses have no idea where they stand.

## Why this matters more than you think

ChatGPT crossed hundreds of millions of active users in 2025. A massive and growing share of those users are asking buying questions. Not "what year was the Eiffel Tower built" questions. Real purchase-intent queries like:

- "What's the best CRM for small teams?"
- "Top email marketing tools for ecommerce"
- "Best accounting software for freelancers"
- "What project management tool should a startup use?"

These are the same queries that used to drive billions in revenue through Google. The difference is that Google showed a page of links and let the buyer decide. AI gives a direct answer. A recommendation. And buyers trust it, because it feels like asking a smart friend instead of sifting through ad-loaded search results.

If your business isn't part of that recommendation, the buyer never discovers you. They don't skip over your listing. They don't decide your competitor is better. They simply never hear your name at all.

The numbers back this up. Gartner projected that traditional organic search traffic would drop 25% by 2026 as AI search absorbs commercial queries. If you're relying on SEO alone, a growing share of your potential buyers are making decisions before they ever see your website.

## The three platforms you need to check

ChatGPT gets the headlines, but it's not the only AI platform making recommendations. There are three you should be monitoring.

### ChatGPT

The biggest by user count. ChatGPT handles everything from casual questions to deep product research. When it browses the web to answer a query, it pulls from authoritative sources, synthesizes the information, and delivers a recommendation. It names names. If someone asks "best proposal software for agencies," ChatGPT will respond with a specific list of tools and a sentence or two about each one.

### Perplexity

Perplexity is built specifically for research. It cites every source, shows its work, and is increasingly used by serious buyers who want to see where information comes from. It crawls the web in real time, so it often surfaces more current information than ChatGPT. If you published a comparison page or got a new G2 review last week, Perplexity might already be citing it.

### Google AI Overviews

Google's AI Overview boxes now appear on the majority of commercial search queries. They sit above the organic results, which means even people who still use Google for search are seeing AI generated recommendations before they see your website listing. If AI Overviews mention your competitors but not you, your Google traffic is being eroded from above.

Each platform has its own quirks, but together they represent where buying decisions are heading. Checking one isn't enough. You need visibility across all three.

## What determines whether AI recommends you

AI recommendations aren't random and they aren't based on who has the biggest ad budget. There's a logic to it, and once you understand the inputs, you can influence the output.

### Training data and web presence

Large language models are trained on massive datasets of web content. If your brand appeared consistently across authoritative sources in that training data, the model has baseline knowledge of who you are and what you do. But this isn't static. ChatGPT now browses the web, Perplexity crawls in real time, and models are updated regularly. Your current web presence matters as much as your historical one.

### Third party mentions

This is the single biggest factor most businesses underestimate. AI platforms heavily weight what other sources say about you. A review on G2, a mention in an industry roundup, a listing on Capterra, a feature in a publication — these are the citations that give AI confidence to recommend you. If the only place your brand appears on the internet is your own website, AI doesn't have enough independent validation to put you on a shortlist.

### Structured content

AI parses structured content far more effectively than freeform prose. FAQ pages, comparison tables, feature lists, pricing grids, and schema markup all give AI clean, extractable information about what you do and how you compare. A well-structured FAQ page with 20 real customer questions does more for your AI visibility than ten 800-word blog posts.

### Authority signals

Links from authoritative domains, mentions on .edu and .gov sites, press coverage, and citations in academic or industry research all signal to AI that your brand is established and credible. This is similar to how backlinks work in SEO, but AI doesn't just count links. It evaluates the quality and relevance of the sources that mention you.

### Freshness

A product with reviews from 2024 and no recent web activity looks abandoned. AI platforms factor in recency, especially Perplexity and ChatGPT when they browse the web. Recent reviews, fresh content, and updated comparison pages signal that you're active, maintained, and trustworthy.

## How to check: manual vs. automated

### The manual approach

You can check your AI visibility right now for free. Open each platform and ask 10 to 15 questions that a buyer in your market would ask:

- "What's the best [category] tool?"
- "Best [category] for [your target audience]?"
- "[Your brand] vs [top competitor]"
- "Top alternatives to [big competitor]"
- "Is [your brand] any good?"

Write down the results. Note whether you're mentioned, where you appear relative to competitors, and what the AI says about you. Repeat this across ChatGPT, Perplexity, and Google AI Overviews.

This works, but it has real limitations. You're checking a handful of queries out of thousands. You're doing it from one location at one point in time. AI responses vary based on phrasing, context, and model updates. By the time you finish your manual audit, the results may have already shifted.

### The automated approach

CabbageSEO runs this check automatically, across all three platforms, with dozens of real buyer queries relevant to your industry. It tracks your visibility over time, scores you on a six-factor scale, and tells you exactly where you're being mentioned, where you're missing, and what to fix first. More on this at the end.

## If you're NOT mentioned: what to do about it

Being invisible to AI isn't permanent. Unlike Google rankings, which can take months to move, AI platforms update frequently. The right actions today can change your visibility within weeks.

### Create structured content AI can parse

AI loves content that directly answers questions in a clean format. Focus on:

- **FAQ pages** with 15 to 20 real questions from your customers. Not marketing questions. Actual questions from support tickets, sales calls, and onboarding sessions. Use FAQPage schema markup so AI can extract the Q&A pairs directly.
- **Comparison tables** that honestly evaluate your product against competitors. Include feature grids, pricing, pros and cons, and "best for" recommendations. AI reliably pulls from structured comparison content when generating recommendations.
- **Direct answer pages** that target the exact questions buyers ask AI. If buyers ask "what's the best invoicing tool for freelancers," create a page that directly answers that question with substantive, structured content.

### Get listed on trust platforms

Third party validation is non-negotiable for AI visibility. These are the sources AI looks to when deciding whether to recommend you:

- **G2** — the dominant B2B review platform. Create a profile and ask 5 to 10 customers to leave honest reviews.
- **Capterra and GetApp** — broad reach, especially for software categories.
- **Trustpilot** — important for consumer-facing and SMB products.
- **Yelp** — critical if you have any local or service component.
- **Product Hunt** — strong signal for newer products.
- **Industry-specific directories** — every niche has them. Find the ones buyers in your market actually use.

You don't need hundreds of reviews. Even a handful of genuine reviews on G2 and Capterra puts you on AI's radar where you had zero signal before.

### Build authority signals

Authority comes from being referenced by credible sources. Tactics that work:

- **Guest posts on industry publications** that your target buyers actually read. Focus on genuinely useful content, not promotional pieces.
- **Press mentions** — even a brief mention in a roundup article in a relevant publication creates a citation AI can find.
- **Links from .edu and .gov sites** — partnerships with universities, participation in government programs, or being cited in academic research carry outsized authority weight.
- **Integration partner pages** — if you integrate with other tools, get listed on their partners or integrations page. Each listing is a credible third party mention.

### Publish content that answers AI queries directly

Look at the specific questions AI is being asked about your category. Then create content that answers those questions better than anything else on the internet.

This isn't traditional SEO content. You're not optimizing for keywords. You're creating the source material that AI will draw from when generating its answer. The more directly and substantively your content answers the exact question, the more likely AI is to cite it.

## If you ARE mentioned but competitors rank higher

Being mentioned is a start, but position matters. If ChatGPT lists your competitor first and you fourth, most buyers will investigate the first name and never get to yours.

This is where gap analysis comes in. You need to understand what your competitors are doing that you're not:

- **Do they have more third party mentions?** Check their G2 reviews, Capterra presence, press coverage, and directory listings compared to yours.
- **Is their content more structured?** Look at their comparison pages, FAQ content, and schema markup. If they have detailed vs. pages and you don't, that's likely why they rank higher.
- **Are they fresher?** If their latest reviews and content are from last week and yours are from last year, recency is working against you.
- **Is their entity signal clearer?** If AI can describe what your competitor does in one sentence but struggles with your brand, your entity clarity needs work.

Close the gaps one by one. Start with the highest leverage item, which is usually third party mentions and structured comparison content. Track your position over time to see what moves the needle.

## Stop guessing. Start measuring.

The biggest mistake businesses make with AI visibility is never checking in the first place. You wouldn't run a Google Ads campaign without looking at the analytics. You wouldn't ignore your search rankings for months at a time. But most businesses have never once checked whether AI recommends them, and they're losing potential customers every day because of it.

You can do the manual check described above. It'll take about an hour and give you a snapshot. But if you want continuous monitoring across all three platforms, with competitive tracking, a visibility score you can measure over time, and specific prioritized actions to improve your position, that's what CabbageSEO is built for.
