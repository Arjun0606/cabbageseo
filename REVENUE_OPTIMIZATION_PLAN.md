# Revenue Optimization Plan - $100k MRR by June

**Status:** Implementation in Progress  
**Goal:** $100k MRR by June 2025  
**Timeline:** ~5 months

---

## 🎯 Core Strategy

**Positioning:** "AI is recommending your competitors instead of you."

**Key Principles:**
1. Fear-based, not productivity-based
2. Losses are LOUD, wins are secondary
3. One metric only: High-Intent Queries Missed
4. Immediate gut punch (no empty states)
5. Progress tracking (movement, not snapshots)

---

## 🔥 Priority 1: Dashboard - Losses First (CRITICAL)

### Current Problem
- Dashboard shows wins and losses equally
- Multiple metrics confuse users
- No urgency

### Changes Needed

#### A. ONE Metric at Top
**Show:** `⚠️ 7 buyer-intent queries where AI recommends competitors`

**Remove:**
- AI Mention Share %
- Multiple stat cards
- Jargon

#### B. Losses Section FIRST
- Red accent, warning icons
- Copy: "AI chose competitors"
- Show query, platform, competitors mentioned
- "Why not me?" link prominent

#### C. Wins Section SECONDARY
- Smaller, muted green
- Below losses
- Less prominent

**Impact:** 2-3x conversion increase

---

## 🔥 Priority 2: Onboarding - Auto-Run Scan

### Current Problem
- Users see empty dashboard
- They think "maybe I'm fine"
- No immediate pain

### Changes Needed

#### A. Auto-Run Scan Immediately
- After signup → auto-run scan
- Stream output (terminal-style)
- Show losses immediately

#### B. No Empty Dashboard
- Never show empty state
- Always show scan results
- Force gut punch before thinking

**Impact:** 5-10x conversion increase

---

## 🔥 Priority 3: Homepage - Show Competitors Immediately

### Current Problem
- Domain check exists but not prominent enough
- Users don't see competitors before signup

### Changes Needed

#### A. Free Domain Check Above Fold
- Show competitors immediately
- No email required
- Results before signup

#### B. Demo Brand Button
- "See how AI treats Notion"
- Build trust without commitment

**Impact:** 2x conversion increase

---

## 🔥 Priority 4: Progress Tracking

### Current Problem
- Users see snapshots, not progress
- No sense of motion
- Easy to cancel

### Changes Needed

#### A. Week-Over-Week Prominent
- Show: Week 1: 0 mentions → Week 2: 1 mention → Week 3: 3 mentions
- Visual progress bar
- "You're improving" messaging

#### B. First Win Engineered
- Identify low-competition query
- Guide user to that
- "You're 1 step away from being mentioned"

**Impact:** 50% churn reduction

---

## 🔥 Priority 5: Email Alerts

### Current Problem
- No emotional pull-back mechanism
- Users forget about product

### Changes Needed

#### A. Competitor Movement Alerts
- "ClickUp just overtook you in 'best project tools'"
- Fear-based, not hope-based
- Pulls users back emotionally

**Impact:** 30% retention increase
